# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their watch history and liked lists.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - User Behavior Analysis

## Project Highlights

1. **Content-Based Filtering:**
   - Utilized content-based filtering to recommend movies based on the attributes and features of the movies themselves.
   - Incorporated movie genres, actors, directors, and other metadata for content-based recommendations.

2. **Watch History:**
   - Analyzed user watch history to suggest movies that align with their viewing patterns and preferences.

3. **Liked List-Based Recommendations:**

4. **Hybrid Approach:**
   - Integrated both content-based filtering and user behavior analysis to create a robust recommendation system.
   - Improved recommendation accuracy by considering both the movie attributes and user preferences.
